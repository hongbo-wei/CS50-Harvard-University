Question 1: If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
Answer 1: Their audio aura is determined by the highest average of energy, valence, and danceability in descending order.


Question 2: Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
Answer 2: I think a better way to calculate this aura it to use the data of how many times a user have listened to a song and the total duration of playing that song,
make a query depends on those data in a descending order.
